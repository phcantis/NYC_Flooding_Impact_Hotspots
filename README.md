│   ├── 1_raw              # for input data for the study \n
│   ├── 2_intermediate     # for storing intermediate datasets
│   ├── 3_output           # for final datasets included in the manuscript and from which hotspots maps are created
│   └── 4_display          # for graphical outputs such as plots and maps
