## 📁 Data Folders Set-up and data sharing

Data folders are too large for sharing in this repository, and the full repository takes significant amounts of time and computational power to run. Because of this, a script is provided  download, store, and organize the input and output data of the analysis. 



Once the script is run, a folder with the following structure should appear:

├── data/                 
│   ├── 1_raw/              # for input data for the study
│   ├── 2_intermediate/     # for storing intermediate datasets
│   ├── 3_output/           # for final datasets included in the manuscript and from which hotspots maps are created
│   └── 4_display/          # for graphical outputs such as plots and maps
