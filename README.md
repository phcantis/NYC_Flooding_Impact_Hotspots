## üìÅ Data Folders Set-up and Data Sharing

Data folders are too large for sharing in this repository, and the full repository takes significant amounts of time and computational power to run. 

Because of this, a script is provided download, store, and organize the input and output data of the analysis.

To download the study's data, run the script ```NYCF_data_download.R```. You will be requested to sign in and authorize access to a Google Drive account in order to download the datasets.

Once the script is run, a folder with the following structure should appear:

 ```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                 
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_raw/              # for input data for the study
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_intermediate/     # for storing intermediate datasets
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_output/           # for final datasets included in the manuscript and from which hotspots maps are created
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4_display/          # for graphical outputs such as plots and maps
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Workflow

The analysis counts with 3 key steps, which are run sequentially to feed from the previous step - into the next one.

**1) Generate and compile exposure and vulnerability data into a database:** The script ```NYCF_report_CD_impacts.R``` is programmed to sequentially process raw input data by 1) calculating the distance to flooding hazards by each spatial feature under each different flooding scenario and 2) filtering data and calculating final indicators used in the analysis. The output of this script is a final database with all the data that is then used to produce different exposure indices / hotspot scores per risk attribute and category. Several nested sub-scripts are computed internally. Due to the potential time required to compute them all, these are commented out and their outputs are included in the data folder provided.

**2) Index building:** The script ```NYCF_Index_Build.R``` will use the exposure and social vulnerability indicators generated and stored in a database to compute composite hotspot scores useful to depict which Community Districts rank higher for each of the risk criteria examined.

**3) Plotting:** The scripts ```NYCF_Plotting_Schematic.R``` and ```NYCF_Plotting_Maps.R``` produce the bar plots and maps included in the manuscript and its Supplementary Materials.
